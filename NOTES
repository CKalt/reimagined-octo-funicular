This is git status after before forking to my github.
    I did a `mv .git original_dot_git_dir` then created my own

The above changes allowed my to get the demo working between cdesk and chrislap.

All I had to do was:

1. On chrislap
    hostname -I
        # write down address
    cd signaling 
    python server.py

2. On chrislap
    launch browser and hit:
        http://localhost:8080
    after clicking to allow browser camera access
        little live video using mirror image was shown.

3. On cdesk
    make sure /etc/hosts had a "chrislap" entry for ipaddress from hostname command from step 1.

4. On cdesk
    launch browser and hit:
        http://chrislap:8080

    a big remove camera feed from chrislap webcam should be displayed as well as the remote smaller
        mirror feed.
